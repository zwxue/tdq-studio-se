|A class is a description of a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, methods, relationships, and semantics. A class may use a set of interfaces to specify collections of operations it provides to its environment. In the metamodel, a Class describes a set of objects sharing a collection of Features that are common to the set of objects.
|
|The purpose of a Class is to declare a collection of Features that fully describe the structure and behavior of objects. Some Classes may not be directly instantiated. These Classes are said to be abstract and exist only for other Classes to inherit and reuse the Features declared by them. No object may be a direct instance of an abstract Class, although an object may be an indirect instance of one through a subclass that is non-abstract.
|
|A Class acts as the namespace for various kinds of contained elements defined within its scope, including classes, interfaces and associations (note that this is purely a scoping construction and does not imply anything about aggregation). The contained classes can be used as ordinary classes in the container class. If a class inherits another class, the contents of the ancestor are available to its descendents if the visibility of an element is public or protected; however, if the visibility is private, then the element is not visible and therefore not available in the descendant.

|A data type is a type whose values have no identity (i.e., they are pure values). Data types include primitive built-in types (such as integer and string) as well as definable enumeration types.
|
|In the metamodel, a DataType defines a special kind of Classifier in which operations are all pure functions (i.e., they can return data values but they cannot change data values, because they have no identity). For example, an "add" operation on a number with another number as an argument yields a third number as a result; the target and argument are unchanged.
|
|A DataType is a special kind of Classifier whose instances are primitive values, not objects. For example, integers and strings are usually treated as primitive values. A primitive value does not have an identity, so two occurrences of the same value cannot be differentiated. Usually, DataTypes are used for specification of the type of an attribute or parameter.

|A package is a grouping of model elements.
|
|In the metamodel, Package is a subclass of Namespace. A Package contains ModelElements such as Packages and Classifiers. A Package may also contain Constraints and Dependencies between ModelElements of the Package.
|
|The purpose of the package construct is to provide a general grouping mechanism. In fact, its only semantics is to define a namespace for its contents. The package construct can be used for organizing elements for any purpose; the criteria to use for grouping elements together into one package are not defined.
|
|A package owns a set of model elements, with the implication that if the package is removed from the model, so are the elements owned by the package. Elements with names, such as classifiers, that are owned by the same package must have unique names within the package, although elements in different packages may have the same name.
|
|There may be relationships between elements contained in the same package, and between an element in one package and an element in a surrounding package at any level. In other words, elements “see” all the way out through nested levels of packages.
|
|Elements in peer packages, however, are encapsulated and are not a priori visible to each other. The same goes for elements in contained packages, i.e. packages do not see "inwards".
|
|Elements owned by a Package can be made available to other Packages by importing
|them. Although any ModelElement may be imported by a Package, imported
|ModelElements are typically other Packages. When an element is imported by a
|package it extends the namespace of that package. Thus the elements available in a

|A constraint is a semantic condition or restriction expressed in text.
|
|In the metamodel, a Constraint is a BooleanExpression on an associated ModelElement(s) which must be true for the model to be well formed. This restriction can be stated in natural language, or in different kinds of languages with well-defined semantics. Certain Constraints are predefined, others may be user defined. Note that a Constraint is an assertion, not an executable mechanism.
|
|The specification is written as an expression in a designated constraint language. The language can be specially designed for writing constraints (such as OCL), a programming language, mathematical notation, or natural language. If constraints are to be enforced by a model editor tool, then the tool must understand the syntax and semantics of the constraint language. Because the choice of language is arbitrary, constraints can be used as an extension mechanism.
|
|The constraint concept allows new semantics to be specified linguistically for a model element. In the metamodel a Constraint directly attached to a ModelElement describes semantic restrictions that this ModelElement must obey.

|A dependency states that the implementation or functioning of one or more elements requires the presence of one or more other elements.
|
|In the metamodel, a Dependency is a directed relationship from a client (or clients) to a supplier (or suppliers) stating that the client is dependent on the supplier (i.e., the client element requires the presence and knowledge of the supplier element).
|
|A dependency specifies that the semantics of a set of model elements requires the presence of another set of model elements. This implies that if the source is somehow modified, the dependents probably must be modified. The reason for the dependency can be specified in several different ways (e.g., using natural language or an algorithm) but is often implicit.
|
|Whenever the supplier element of a dependency changes, the client element is potentially invalidated. After such invalidation, a check should be performed followed by possible changes to the derived client element. Such a check should be performed after which action can be taken to change the derived element to validate it again.
